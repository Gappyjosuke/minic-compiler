## The Common Problem
Finding clear, working, and well-documented code for the **Compiler Design Lab** in Anna University is often difficult. This repository was created to save students time by providing a "Ready-to-Use" reference. 

Instead of typing sh*t tons of code from low-quality PDFs, you can find verified, clean code for all 7 experiments here, along with a complete Lab Manual.
